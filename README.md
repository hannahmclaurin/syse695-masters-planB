## Master of Science in Systems Engineering - Plan B Project Repository

This repository contains the materials and code developed for the master's project titled **"An Introductory Simulation-Based Comparison of Systems Engineering Frameworks for Medium-Scale Scientific Infrastructure Projects."** 
It includes the LaTeX report and a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation used to analyze the effects of systems engineering framework selection on project performance.

## Abstract

Medium-scale scientific infrastructure projects exist between small laboratory experiments and large mission driven facilities. 
These projects face growing technical complexity and safety requirements while operating with limited resources and evolving goals. 
Traditional systems engineering frameworks such as the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook provide rigor but can burden research teams with documentation and governance unsuited to their agility. 
Minimal approaches allow flexibility but risk poor integration readiness and reduced data quality. 
CERN developed the OpenSE framework to offer a lean and safety focused alternative designed for research environments, yet its effectiveness outside accelerator contexts is not well studied. 

This project compares three framework conditions: minimal approach, OpenSE, and traditional systems engineering. 
An initial, non-exhaustive literature review identifies success metrics for research infrastructure projects and establishes structural differences among the frameworks. 
A crude virtual project model, based on representative assumptions from experience working with the COHERENT experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is used to simulate project outcomes under each framework. 
Results provide an initial view of how framework choice influences project success and readiness in research infrastructure contexts.

## Review and Feedback

If appropriate, advisors and committee members are welcomed to use the **`draft-review`** branch when providing comments or suggestions. All forms of feedback are extremely useful.

Please do not commit changes directly to the `main` branch.  
Pull requests or inline comments in the draft branch are preferred so that discussion history and version context are preserved.

If you are providing feedback on the report:
- Comment directly in the `.tex` files using LaTeX comment syntax (`% comment here`), or  
- Open a GitHub pull request with review notes.
